The random module is not intended for generating cryptographic secrets; it is a PRNG whose outputs can be predictable given sufficient information about the seed/state. Using it to generate passwords can produce weak or guessable passwords and is inappropriate for any security-sensitive secret generation.",

In Python prefer the secrets module (e.g., secrets.choice, secrets.token_urlsafe, or secrets.token_bytes) to generate secrets. Replace random.choice(...) with secrets.choice(...) or generate a secure random byte sequence and encode it as needed. Example mitigations: use secrets.choice(all_chars) in the generator, or use secrets.token_urlsafe()/token_bytes() and map/encode to the allowed character set.",

Printing secrets to stdout can expose them in terminal history, CI/CD logs, system logs, or other logging/monitoring tools.

If a CLI/test is needed, guard execution with if __name__ == \"__main__\": so secrets are only generated when the module is explicitly executed. Avoid printing passwords; instead return them to the caller or store them securely using appropriate secret management solutions.
