                    "reasoning": "The code unconditionally writes the result of conf.httpCollector.obtain() into a file specified by conf.harFile. An HTTP collector typically includes full HTTP requests and responses (URLs, headers, cookies, authorization tokens, bodies), which can contain sensitive data (credentials, session tokens, personally identifiable information). The dump operation does not perform any redaction, access control, or encryption before writing to disk, so sensitive information may be persisted on disk in cleartext and exposed to local users or backups.",
                    "mitigation": "Before writing HAR data to disk, explicitly redact or remove sensitive fields (e.g., Authorization headers, cookies, POST bodies with credentials). Enforce safe file permissions (e.g., owner-only read/write), validate and limit the path where HAR files may be written (avoid writing to arbitrary locations), and consider encrypting the file at rest or requiring an explicit opt-in flag to persist full request/response data. Log an explicit warning to the user when writing potentially sensitive data.",

If conf.tempDirs can be influenced by a user, configuration file, or external input, this behavior can result in removal of arbitrary directories and files outside of the intended application scope. There is no validation that tempDir is inside an expected base directory, nor any safety checks preventing accidental or malicious deletion of important system or user data.",
                    "mitigation": "Validate and canonicalize each tempDir before performing removal (resolve realpath and ensure it is a subdirectory of an allowed base temp directory). Limit deletions to known safe prefixes and only remove files created by the application (e.g., track created files and remove those specifically). Avoid blind calls to shutil.rmtree on configurable paths. Consider adding a dry-run or explicit confirmation step for destructive cleanup, and ensure file operations run with least privilege.",

Importing a module can execute arbitrary initialization code (start threads, open network sockets, access filesystem, etc.). This means merely importing sqlmap.py as a library could trigger substantial side effects in the hosting application or CI/CD environment. Import-time side effects can be unexpected and may cause privilege, resource, or security issues in environments that import this module for analysis or tooling.",
                    "mitigation": "Avoid performing potentially side-effecting imports at module import time. Defer imports to functions that explicitly request the behavior (lazy import), or guard side-effecting imports behind an explicit API call or configuration flag. Document the import-time behavior clearly. If the import is only needed for CI/CD checks, consider providing a no-op stub or a separate entry-point that CI/CD can call instead of importing the main module.",

                    "reasoning": "The code replaces the global sys.stdout and sys.stderr with StdDbOut instances that write to an IPC database when conf.get('api') is true. This redirection captures all output from the process (including third-party libraries) and sends it to an IPC backend keyed by conf.taskid. If conf.taskid or the IPC mechanism can be influenced by an attacker, sensitive output (including secrets printed to stdout/stderr) could be exfiltrated to or overwritten in the IPC database. Reassigning these globals also changes the behavior expected by other libraries relying on standard file-like objects.",
