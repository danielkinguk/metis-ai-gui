The random module (Mersenne Twister) is not a cryptographically secure PRNG and is predictable if an attacker can infer or guess the seed/state. Using it to generate secrets such as passwords can allow attackers to reproduce or guess generated passwords.",

In Python, prefer the secrets module (e.g., secrets.choice, secrets.token_urlsafe, or secrets.token_bytes) or os.urandom.
