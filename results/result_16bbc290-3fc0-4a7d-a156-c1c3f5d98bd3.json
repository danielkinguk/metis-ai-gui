                    "reasoning": "The code uses the 'random' module (Mersenne Twister) to select characters for a password. The Python 'random' module is not suitable for generating cryptographic secrets because its outputs are predictable if the internal state is observed or partially known. Using a non-cryptographic PRNG to produce passwords can make generated passwords guessable or recoverable by an attacker, undermining the secrecy of the password.",
                    "mitigation": "Use a cryptographically secure source of randomness, for example the 'secrets' module in Python 3 (secrets.choice, secrets.token_bytes, secrets.token_urlsafe, etc.).

Especially with short lengths (e.g., length=4..8) this can frequently produce passwords that do not meet common complexity policies. A password generator intended for adoption should ensure compliance with policy requirements rather than relying on chance.",
