                    "reasoning": "The code uses the random module's random.choice to select characters. The random module (Mersenne Twister) is not designed to be cryptographically secure or unpredictable for secret generation. Passwords generated this way can be predictable if the RNG state is discovered or if an attacker can infer the internal state, which undermines the confidentiality of generated secrets and makes them vulnerable to brute-force or state-prediction attacks.",
                    "mitigation": "Use a cryptographically secure random generator intended for secrets. In Python, use the secrets module (e.g., secrets.choice or secrets.token_urlsafe) or secrets.SystemRandom. Example: use secrets.choice(all_chars) or secrets.token_urlsafe() and then format/trim as needed. Ensure chosen approach provides sufficient entropy for the required password length.",

                    "reasoning": "The script generates a password and immediately prints it to stdout. Printing secrets to console risks accidental exposure via terminal history, logs, monitoring systems, CI job logs, or other users on a shared system. Test/demo code that emits secrets can result in persistent leakage of credentials.",

If demonstrating locally, ensure output is handled securely (e.g., display only interactively to the intended user, avoid logging, or write to a secure credential store). Consider returning the password from functions without side effects and let callers decide secure handling. For automated environments, avoid emitting secrets to logs altogether.",

                    "reasoning": "Although the character pool includes letters, digits, and punctuation, the selection is purely random and does not guarantee the resulting password contains at least one character from each required class (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special). A randomly produced password can therefore fail to meet password policy requirements or have reduced effective complexity (e.g., all letters), increasing the risk of compromise.",
                    "mitigation": "Enforce composition rules explicitly: require and guarantee inclusion of at least one character from each required category by selecting one character from each class first, then filling the remainder randomly, and finally shuffling. Also define and enforce a secure minimum length (e.g., >= 12 or per policy).",

                    "reasoning": "The function accepts length without type or bounds checking. If called with an extremely large integer, it can cause high memory and CPU consumption (Denial of Service). If called with non-integer types, it may raise exceptions. Negative lengths produce an empty password (range(length) with negative length yields empty iteration), which may result in generation of an unusable secret.",
                    "mitigation": "Validate the length parameter: ensure it is an integer within a safe, policy-defined range (e.g., min_length >= 8 or 12; max_length to prevent DoS).
