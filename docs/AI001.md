# `AI001` - AI-Generated Security Insight

Tags: `ai`, `security`

This rule is triggered when the AI identifies code that may present a potential security issue.

These findings are not guaranteed vulnerabilities and should be reviewed by a developer before action is taken.

The goal of this rule is to highlight code segments that may warrant closer inspection from a security perspective. Findings may include both well-known patterns and less obvious risks surfaced by the AI model.

Rationale: AI-based analysis can augment security review processes by identifying potentially risky code patterns early. These insights are meant to support, not replace, manual validation and secure development practices.
